# Calculator
This is the Calculator assignment for The Odin Project.

We are required to build a basic functional calculator. It needs to be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. A few things it is required to:

1. String together several operations
2. It should not evaluate more than one single pair of numbers at a time
3. Any decimals should not overflow the screen
4. A clear button should wipe out any existing data
5. Display a snarky message if the user attempts to divide by 0

Extra credit for implementing any of the following:

1. Add a decimal input option which only accepts one decimal
2. Add a backspace button to allow the user to undo an accidental button
3. Add keyboard support
4. Make it look pretty and distinct
